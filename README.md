#Hashtable Performance Analysis

## Zain Ul Abidin

This repository compares different types of hashtables implementations. 

The following are the main types.
  * Collidable Hashtable
    This implementation do not use any type of probing technique. Collisions are not resolved at all.
  * Linear Hashtable
    This implemetation use linear probing for collision resolution.
  * Quadratic Hashtable
    This implemetation use quadratic probing for collision resolution.
  * Logarithmic Hashtable
    This implemetation use logarithemic probing for collision resolution.
  * Double Hashtable
    This implemetation use double probing for collision resolution.
